# Household Purchases Dashboard – Power BI Project
## Overview
As part of a personal effort to better manage household expenses, I created a dashboard that analyzes our grocery shopping habits over a 6-month period.

Initially, I turned to ChatGPT to help generate a reusable grocery list—but after hitting usage limits, I realized I could build a full data solution myself.

## Goals
* Track and analyze online grocery purchases.

* Identify buying patterns and recurring products.

* Create a reusable grocery list based on actual data.

* Explore monthly expense trends and anomalies.

## Tools Used

* Power BI – Cleaning, Data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation.

## Key Insights
* Number of shopping trips per month.

* Average number of items per purchase.

* Monthly spending trends (including unexpected anomalies).

* List of the 48 most frequently purchased items.

## Example Insights
* Significant difference in spending between February and March (under investigation).

* High frequency of specific items like cottage cheese and potato chips
